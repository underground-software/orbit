How to setup a development environment:
=======================================

1. Install docker and docker-compose or a drop-in replacement for each.

2. Setup and enter a python virtualenv for development (e.g. `python -m venv orbit-dev && source orbit-dev/bin/activate`).

3. Install the development dependencies: `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`>

4. Build and launch orbit with `cd docker && docker-compose up --build`.

5. Orbit is now available as a web app. Use `cd docker && docker-compose down to return to earth before re-launching with new changes.

6. Use `test-style.sh` to ensure style compliance before contributing code.
