### TL;DR:

The Kernel Development Learning Pipeline (KDLP) program aims to create a comprehensive Linux kernel talent pipeline to address the current shortage of qualified entry level kernel candidates. 

### Mission statement

Throughout the industry, there is a shortage of qualified entry-level software engineers focused on systems programming, especially within the niche of developing for the Linux kernel.
As junior software engineers ourselves, this quickly became evident to us, and we are not the only people concerned about it.

Engineers and managers of all levels within our industry niche have observed that we must bring new talent into these spaces, and we must do so urgently.
Time spares no one, not even the most legendary programmers of yore, and if we do not identify and train the next generation, there will be no one to carry the torch of systems programming.

We have had the chance to work with many talented and experienced engineers firsthand, and we have benefited greatly from their guidance and mentorship, but we know that this opportunity will not last forever.
In response, we have created the Kernel Development Learning Pipeline, a program to bridge the gaps between academia and industry, between the novice and the legend, between the past and the future.

### More detail

KDLP is a novel program run by Red Hat engineers to address the industry-wide shortage of qualified entry-level candidates for low-level software engineering jobs in general, and the Linux kernel in particular.

We created, developed, and teach an "Introduction to Linux Kernel" development course to University of Massachusetts Lowell students and anyone who is [interested](https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/958fe36a-d763-4422-81af-c5ecf2465957).

We recruit qualified students from our class to internship programs within Red Hat, and we promote the best interns to hiring managers with the aim of bringing them into the industry as full time software engineers.

We have pulled together this program from scratch over the past few years, iterating our program and curriculum design in order to stand the program on its feet.

As an established program, we plan to continue to scale our program and strengthen our partnerships, including a recent one with the Linux Foundation, in order to bring Linux kernel and low-level software engineering education to a larger audience and global talent pool.
